Gabriela Bravo - Lab 7
Task One (https://editor.p5js.org/gabyb/sketches/n-djOVa_p): I was only able to get this task done since I had trouble firguring out why one of my loops wasnt showing up. My first step to creating the a loop was making a function. I defined it's x,y variables above set up, and used a loop to repeat my ellipses up to 40 times. Using an array (four different colors), I used the fandom function along with it to have the circles change color every run.
Task Two (https://editor.p5js.org/gabyb/sketches/9kOtEaZIY): I didn't have time to finish anything past this, but I reached the point where I nestled a loop within a loop. I don't know who to effect Y and multiply it.
